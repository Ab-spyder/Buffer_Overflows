## Simple Buffer Overflow

The objective here was to exploit a very simple buffer overflow in the program called vuln_prog.

First, I have run vuln_prog with gdb using the command: gdb vuln_prog

The size of the buffer in the program is 500 bytes. So we can try printing A's and try to fill up the buffer. We can use python or perl script. Run the following command in gdb.
```
run $(python -c "print('A'*500)")
```
The program exits normally. We now increment the A's and see if there is any variation in the output. At 508 A's we get a segmentation fault. While incrementing the number of A's and testing with gdb, we can confirm that the return address starts when we fill with 512 A's.

The next step is to place a working shell code in the buffer. First, test the shellcode to check if it works before placing it in the buffer. Next, we insert the NOP sled to solve the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer, as it increases the size of the target area. Our shell code is 45 bytes, so the rest of the 467 bytes (512 bytes, where the return address starts - 45 bytes, which is the size of shellcode) can be NOP (\x90) to fill up the buffer. Finally, we need to add the return address to our payload.
Any memory address in the NOP can be chosen as the return address and added to payload in little endian format.

The final payload:
```
$(python -c 'print "\x90"*467 + "\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0""\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b""\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c""\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd""\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh" + "\x58\xd9\xff\xff"')
```
