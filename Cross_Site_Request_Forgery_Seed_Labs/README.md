# Cross-Site Request Forgery
## Introduction

A CSRF attack involves a victim user, a trusted site, and a malicious site. The victim user holds an active session with a trusted site while visiting a malicious site. The malicious site injects an HTTP request for the trusted site into the victim user session, causing damages. 

## Task

We need to exploit a CSRF vulnerability in the vulnerable web application named Elgg. Elgg is a very popular open-source web application for social network, and it has implemented a number of countermeasures to remedy the XSS threat.
